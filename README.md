# Hydrostaic Bearing Designer 


## About


_Hydrostaic Bearing Designer_ is an app for hydrostatic bearing parameter calculation, stiffness performance prediction, spindle error motion test, and digital twin demonstration. By providing a truly easy to use app for hydrostatic bearing design, makes _Hydrostatic Bearing Designer_ an ideal tool for students in  Course _Precision Machine Design_ learning Hydrostatic bearing, Spindle error motion, and Digital twin in a simple and convenient way.



## System Requirements


_Hydrostatic Bearing Designer_ is expected to work with MATLAB R2022a or above. 


## MATLAB速 Toolbox Installation

Follow the steps below to install _Hydrostatic Bearing Designer_ as a MATLAB速 toolbox

1) Download the
   [Hydrostatic Bearing Designer.mlappinstall](https://github.com/precise-simulation/featool-multiphysics/releases/latest/download/FEATool_Multiphysics.mlappinstall)
   toolbox installation file.

2) Then start MATLAB速, press the **APPS** toolbar button,
   and select the **Install App** button.

3) When prompted to choose a toolbox file to install, select the
   **Hydrostatic Bearing Designer.mlappinstall** file and press **OK**.

4) Press the **Install** button if prompted to _"Install to My Apps"_.

Once the toolbox has been installed, an app icon will be available in
the _APPS_ toolbar to start the _Hydrostatic Bearing Designer_ GUI. (Note that MATLAB速 may
not show or give any indication of the toolbox installation progress
or completion.)


## Tutorials

The app can be divided into two sections: Hydrostatic bearing design and Spindle error motion.

### Hydrostatic bearing design

1. Input the oil specification, restrictor size, and bearing size, and the parameters related to the machine will be generated.

2. Check bearing performance to decide wheather it meets our need.

### Spindle error motion

1. Read the data from dual ball bar experiment.

2. Check the spindle error motion performance of the real hydrostatic spindle.

3. Display the virtual model of the real machine spindle and calculate the suspected oil film thickness.

>**Note**
>The CAD model demonstrates how digital twin will work, however it's not synchornized with the real machine model.
